# About _GothicKit_

_GothicKit_ is a community-run organization hosting libraries and tools for the early 2000's games _Gothic_ and _Gothic II_. These games are still today being played, modded and adapted by many passionate fans, so good tooling, libraries and documentation are needed. That's where _GothicKit_ comes in. Currently, we provide the [_ZenKit_](https://github.com/GothicKit/ZenKit) library, originally known as _lmichaelis/phoenix_, an asset parser for both _Gothic_ and _Gothic II_, written in C++ as well as bindings for other programming languages [like C](https://github.com/GothicKit/ZenKitCAPI). There is also [_phoenix studio_](https://github.com/GothicKit/phoenix-studio) which uses _ZenKit_ to provide a set of tools for inspecting and converting game files from the terminal.
